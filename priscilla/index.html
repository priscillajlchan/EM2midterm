			<h3>A Brief history of Vancouver’s Popular Stanley Park Seawall</h3>
			
			<div class="units-row">
				<article class="unit-75">
					<p>Located near Downtown, Vancouver. The seawall is a scenic 22 KM path that surrounds Stanley Park. Extremely popular among locals and tourist. It’s the perfect place for a walk, cycle or jog. 
					<p>Construction of the Seawall began in 1917. James Cunningham was very invovled in the building of the seawall. He surprivised the project until his last breathe. It’s unfortunte that he never got to see the seawall complete. In honors of his work, there’s a plaque dedicated to him that can be found near Siwash Rock. (the place where his ashes were scattered).
					<p>Today, the seawall still faces conflict when it comes to sharing the path with cylists and pedestrians. Collisons were becoming an issue. Currently, their still working towards expanding and extending the seawall overall. Mainly focusing along the seaside. Hopefully for year’s to come, it’ll continue to remain a favorite.

				<article class="unit-40">
				<p> A raindrop of Vancouvrite, born and raised here. Aspiring Graphic design that's OCD about type and graphics. Pianist and occasional blogger.When i'm not sitting behind a screen, i like stuffing my face with delicious food and capturing every moment of it. I believe everything happens for a reason and there's no need to stress the small stuff. Sometimes, even the strong falls down. Over the last few years, I've found my personal sancutary, a spot at the seawall. Here I let my mind get lost in the vast sea.
